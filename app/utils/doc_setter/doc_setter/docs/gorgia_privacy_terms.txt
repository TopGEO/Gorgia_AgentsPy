### Introduction
These Terms and Conditions form a binding agreement between you and LLC “Gorgia” (the “Company”).  
They govern the use of Gorgia.ge website and online store, including related services and communications.

Personal data collected from you or third parties is processed according to the Privacy Policy defined herein.  
By agreeing to these Terms, you also consent to Gorgia.ge’s Privacy Policy and Return/Exchange Policy.

When a customer opens a personal account on Gorgia.ge to purchase products, both parties agree to a contract that regulates:
- Account registration and use.  
- Sales, delivery, payment, commissions, and account closure procedures.

All users must carefully read these Terms before using the website.

### Force Majeure

Deadlines will be extended for the duration of such events.  
Affected parties must promptly notify the other, providing documentation from a competent authority.  
Failure to notify removes the right to claim force majeure as an excuse.
