Warranty Service Terms

The warranty service is based on Georgian legislation and grants the consumer the right, within 2 (two) years from the date of purchase, to request free repair or replacement of the item, withdraw from the contract, or demand a price reduction if the product is found to be defective during the warranty period. If a defect is discovered within six months of the consumer taking possession of the item, it is presumed that the defect existed at the time of delivery unless the nature of the goods or the defect makes this impossible. In this case, the burden of proof lies with the seller. If the defect is discovered after six months, the burden of proof that the defect existed at the time of delivery lies with the consumer.

The consumer has the right to request free repair or replacement of the item from “Zoommer Georgia,” unless such action is impossible due to the nature of the product or would result in disproportionate or unreasonable costs.

The item must be repaired or replaced within a reasonable time, not exceeding 15 working days. If a spare part must be ordered from abroad or the product must be sent to an authorized service center overseas, the repair period is extended to 30 working days.

Free repair or replacement means that “Zoommer Georgia” will bear all expenses (including postal, labor, and material costs) necessary to ensure the product complies with contractual terms.

The consumer has the right to request a price reduction or withdraw from the contract if any of the following apply:
- The product cannot be repaired or replaced within a reasonable time;
- “Zoommer Georgia” did not repair or replace the item within a reasonable time, and the consumer has lost interest in contract performance;
- Repair or replacement by “Zoommer Georgia” would cause significant inconvenience to the consumer.
Reimbursement is made according to Georgian law.

The consumer cannot withdraw from the contract if the defect is minor.*

When determining whether the cost is disproportionate or unreasonable, the following factors must be considered:

a) The price of the item or service if it were in full compliance with the contract;
b) The extent of non-compliance with the contract;
c) The availability of an alternative method to eliminate the defect without causing inconvenience to the consumer.

Warranty services are provided by LLC “Technoline.”
