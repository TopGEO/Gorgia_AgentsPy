Career at Zoommer

Our Development History:

Zoommer’s story began in 2009 with a single branch. At that time, Zoommer only had a wholesale direction, great hopes, and even greater ambitions.

Today, we unite 18 branches and the largest B2C platform across Georgia. We believe in the bright side of technological progress, the power of curiosity, and the drive for innovation.

For 14 years now, we have been exploring technology, engaging with new gadgets, and discovering the most uncharted areas of tech.

Our mission remains unchanged — we want to help people keep up with innovations and feel at home with technology.


Your Development Story:

Technology and its limitless possibilities are created by people, right? That’s why we primarily believe in people and their potential. We value and encourage every idea, initiative, or opinion that inspires positive change.

If you are driven by growth, speed, creativity, and the desire to bring ideas to life immediately — we have a lot in common.

We promise to support your professional and personal development — through training, team activities, daily work, and collaboration.

Here you will find the stable, diverse, and engaging work environment you’ve been searching for.
