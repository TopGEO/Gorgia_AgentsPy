Item Return
Conditions for Returning Goods Purchased Remotely

When purchasing an item under a distance or off-premises contract, the consumer has the right to withdraw from the contract within 14 calendar days without providing any reason. In this case, the consumer must return the product to “Zoommer Georgia” at their own expense (including transportation, dismantling, and other related costs), if the value of the product exceeds 30 GEL.


Right to Withdraw from a Distance or Off-Premises Contract

Except as provided by Georgian law and Article 5 of this policy, the consumer has the right to withdraw from a distance or off-premises contract within 14 calendar days without providing any reason. This period is calculated as follows:
a) For service contracts – from the date of contract conclusion;
b) For purchase contracts – from the date the consumer or a third party designated by them (other than the carrier) takes possession of the goods;
c) For goods ordered in parts – from the date the consumer or a third party designated by them (other than the carrier) takes possession of the last item;
d) For regularly delivered goods (with a defined frequency) – from the date the consumer or a third party designated by them (other than the carrier) first takes possession of the goods.

If the consumer withdraws from the contract, they will not bear any costs (including delivery costs) except in cases where the consumer chose a more expensive delivery method than the standard one offered by “Zoommer,” or the product value decreased due to use beyond what is necessary to establish its nature, characteristics, or functioning. The consumer is not required to compensate any decrease in value if “Zoommer” failed to inform them of their legal right to withdraw.

Withdrawal from a distance contract automatically results in withdrawal from any related contracts and restores the parties to their original state.

The consumer must send “Zoommer” a completed form (Appendix 1) or other clear evidence reflecting their decision to return the goods within the specified period. The burden of proof that the right of withdrawal was exercised within the established time lies with the consumer.

The consumer is considered to have exercised the right of withdrawal if the withdrawal notice is sent to “Zoommer” before the expiration of the specified period. The burden of proof that the right was exercised according to this clause also lies with the consumer.

If “Zoommer” does not inform the consumer of their right to return goods or services, the consumer may return them within 12 months after the initial 14-day period expires.

If “Zoommer” provides the information within 12 months after the withdrawal period starts, the 7-day withdrawal period begins from the day the consumer receives the information.


Exceptions to the Right of Withdrawal Without Reason

The consumer has no right to withdraw from the contract if:
a) “Zoommer” has fully provided the service, began the service with the consumer’s prior consent, and the consumer acknowledged they would lose the right of withdrawal upon full completion of the service;
b) The contract price of the goods or services depends on market fluctuations beyond “Zoommer’s” control during the withdrawal period;
c) The goods or services were custom-made based on the consumer’s individual request or clearly tailored to their personal needs;
d) The supplied goods are perishable or have a short shelf life;
e) The goods were delivered sealed, the seal was broken after delivery, and the goods cannot be returned for health or hygiene reasons;
f) The goods were inseparably mixed with other goods due to their nature during delivery;
g) Sealed audio/video recordings or software were delivered, and the seal was broken after delivery;
h) Digital content was delivered on a non-physical medium, performance began with the consumer’s prior consent, and the consumer acknowledged that doing so would forfeit their withdrawal right.


Consequences of Withdrawal from the Contract

Withdrawal from the contract cancels all obligations under the distance or off-premises contract, and everything exchanged must be returned. In the event of withdrawal, “Zoommer” must:
a) Refund the consumer in full, including any delivery costs if applicable, without undue delay and no later than 14 calendar days from receiving the withdrawal notice. “Zoommer” is not required to reimburse extra delivery costs if the consumer chose a more expensive delivery method than the standard one offered by “Zoommer.”
b) Reimburse the payment using the same method used by the consumer, unless the consumer agrees otherwise and incurs no additional fees.

In the case of purchase contract withdrawal, “Zoommer” may withhold the refund until the goods are returned or proof of shipment is provided, whichever occurs first, unless “Zoommer” has agreed to collect the goods themselves.

Upon withdrawal, the consumer must:
a) Return the goods to “Zoommer” or its authorized third party immediately after sending the withdrawal notice, but no later than 7 calendar days, unless “Zoommer” has agreed to collect them;
b) Bear only the direct costs of returning the goods unless “Zoommer” agrees to cover them or failed to inform the consumer of these costs. For off-premises contracts where goods were delivered to the consumer’s home, “Zoommer” must collect the goods at its own expense if they cannot reasonably be returned by mail.
