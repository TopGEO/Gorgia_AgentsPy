### Customer Rights (Legal Warranty)

If a product is found to be defective, the customer has the right to request the seller to fix the defect (repair or replace the product free of charge, or reduce the price) or to withdraw from the contract.

Repair or replacement are the customer’s primary rights. The customer may request a free repair or replacement unless impossible due to the nature of the product or it requires disproportionate cost.

The product must be repaired or replaced within a reasonable time, without causing significant inconvenience to the customer considering the nature and purpose of the item.

Free repair or replacement includes all related costs (postage, labor, and materials) necessary to ensure product conformity.

The customer may demand a price reduction or withdraw from the contract if:
a) Repair or replacement is impossible;  
b) The seller failed to repair or replace within a reasonable period, and the customer lost interest in fulfillment;  
c) The repair or replacement causes major inconvenience to the customer.

If the customer withdraws from the contract, they may claim compensation for damages caused by non-performance according to Georgian law.

The customer may not withdraw from the contract if the defect is minor.

When assessing whether the cost is disproportionate, the following factors are considered:
a) The product’s price if it conformed to the contract;  
b) The degree of non-conformity;  
c) The possibility to fix the defect without inconvenience to the customer.

The customer may use these rights if the defect is discovered within two years of delivery.  
If the defect is discovered within six months, it is presumed to have existed at delivery unless proven otherwise.  
After six months, the burden of proof that the defect existed upon delivery lies with the customer.

### 1. Return Policy

According to Article 13 of the Law of Georgia on Consumer Rights Protection, except for exceptions defined in Article 14, the customer may withdraw from a distance or off-premises contract within 14 calendar days without providing any reason.

This period is calculated as follows:
a) For service contracts – from the contract date;  
b) For sales contracts – from the day the customer or their designated third party receives the product;  
c) For partial deliveries – from the receipt of the last item;  
d) For regularly delivered goods – from receipt of the first item.

### 2. Return Conditions

The customer has the right to request a return within 14 calendar days from product delivery.  
The period starts at the time of receiving the product. After the deadline, the right expires.  
The customer must fill out the return form available on the website.

Please fill the form online or visit a branch: **Return Form**

If the customer withdraws, they must return the item to the seller or designated third party immediately, no later than 7 calendar days after sending the withdrawal notice, and cover direct return costs.

If the product does not match the website description, has an initial defect, or was damaged during delivery, the seller bears all return costs.

The customer must return the item with all accompanying documents.

The seller must refund the customer within 14 calendar days after receiving the return notice.  
The seller may withhold the refund until receiving the returned product or proof of shipment, whichever occurs first.

Refunds will be made using the same payment method unless otherwise agreed with the customer.

Withdrawal from a distance contract automatically terminates any associated contracts and restores the initial condition.

All obligations under the contract are annulled, and any received goods or payments are returned.

The customer may not withdraw from contracts for goods or services priced under 30 GEL.

### 3. Delivery Cost Reimbursement Rules

When the customer withdraws, they bear no costs (including delivery) unless they chose a more expensive delivery option than the standard one, or the product’s value decreased due to use beyond necessary inspection.

If the seller failed to inform the customer of their withdrawal rights under the law, the customer is not obliged to cover any price difference.
