Through this initiative, customers were encouraged to return their used components to Gorgia and, in return, received discounts on a special hexa-ingredient concrete mix. 
All collected components were processed according to Georgia’s environmental regulations.

The first phase of this initiative included a comprehensive educational campaign to raise awareness about the environmental harm caused by these materials.

Information on this project reached over 500,000 Gorgia customers through various communication channels and store locations.

Within the first three months, users brought in over 20,000 used elements.

All Gorgia stores feature dedicated containers for collecting broken or unused electric household appliances. These collected items are then recycled and transformed into new, functional products.

Gorgia was also the first company in Georgia to sell paint free of lead (metal), contributing to a healthier and more sustainable environment.
